Win 11 Calculator Replica 
Generally, it's my first fully handmade project that is dedicated mostly to learning purposes. 
The more I learn, the more I throw on top of it.

Honestly, like I expected, I enjoy this type of learning over theory, and it's quite fun to do so.
The most important point is that it is truly hand-made without throwing my problems and bugs into AI and hoping it would autocomplete whatever I was dealing with. 

It's a standard calculator with additional functions

Functions:


>  Perform basic arithmetic [done]
>> Store and display previous calculations [In progress]
>>>  Accept keyboard input [In progress]
>>>>  Theme switcher [Planned]

> May add functions from a scientific calculator [Planned]
